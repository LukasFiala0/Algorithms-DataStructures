HashSet is a collection designed to store unique elements.
A HashSet is implemented as a hash table in most programming languages.
Its operations like add, remove, and contains have an average time complexity of O(1).
It is often used for tasks such as finding unique words in a text, detecting duplicates, or as a quick lookup structure.
